To configure this for your machine:

In the json file, set the two source lines to point to a directory where
the GLM L2 data ("raw") and gridded fields will be saved. The other paths are
within the container.

To run it,

cd ~/sources/glmtools-docker/cron
./glm_cron_service.sh

Change -d to -i -t in the script above to see debug messages.

To stop the service:
When in daemon mode: docker stop docker-cron
When in interactive mode: ctrl-C
